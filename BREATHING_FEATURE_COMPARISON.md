## 2. Missing Features Analysis

### ✅ Previously Missing - Now Implemented

#### 2.1 Wim Hof Method Support ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**What InBreeze Has:**

- Round-based structure (e.g., 3-4 rounds)
- Each round consists of rapid breathing cycles (default 30 breaths)
- Breath retention after final exhale (hold as long as possible)
- Recovery pause between rounds (default 15 seconds)
- Stopwatch to track retention duration

**Why It Matters:**
The Wim Hof Method is a scientifically-backed breathing technique with proven benefits for stress reduction, immune system support, and mental clarity. It's fundamentally different from continuous breathing patterns.

**~~Current Wbot Gap:~~** ✅ RESOLVED
Wbot now fully supports the Wim Hof pattern via `WimHofExercise.tsx` and `useWimHofLoop.ts`:

1. ✅ 30 rapid breaths (`rapid_breathing` phase with auto/manual modes)
2. ✅ Exhale and hold (`retention` phase with stopwatch)
3. ✅ Inhale and hold for 15 seconds (`recovery_inhale` phase)
4. ✅ Recovery pause (`recovery_pause` phase)
5. ✅ Repeat for multiple rounds (3 rounds by default)

---

#### 2.2 Progress Tracking & Analytics 🟡 PARTIAL

**What InBreeze Has:**

- Session history saved with timestamps
- Per-round statistics (duration of each retention hold)
- Monthly calendar view
- Graph visualization of session trends
- Ability to review and delete past sessions

**Why It Matters:**
Progress tracking provides motivation, accountability, and insights into practice consistency. Users can see improvement in breath retention over time.

**Current Wbot Gap:** 🟡 PARTIALLY RESOLVED

- ✅ Database: `breathing_sessions` table exists with full schema
- ✅ Hooks: `useBreathingSession` provides start/complete/update mutations
- ❌ Missing: UI to view past sessions
- ❌ Missing: Charts and analytics visualization
- ❌ Missing: Exercise components don't call session tracking hooks yet

---

#### 2.3 Advanced Customization 🔴 STILL MISSING

**What InBreeze Has:**

- **Tempo control:** Adjustable breathing pace (1000-3000ms per breath)
- **Breaths per round:** Configurable number of rapid breaths (default 30)
- **Precision mode:** Strict timing vs flexible timing
- **Recovery pause:** Adjustable rest between rounds (0-60 seconds)

**Why It Matters:**
Different users have different lung capacities and experience levels. Beginners might need slower tempo and fewer breaths, while advanced practitioners can push further.

**Current Wbot Gap:**
Wbot's techniques have fixed durations with no user control over pacing or repetitions.

---

#### 2.4 Breath-Specific Audio Feedback 🔴 STILL MISSING

**What InBreeze Has:**

- Separate "breath-in.ogg" audio file that plays during inhale
- Separate "breath-out.ogg" audio file that plays during exhale
- Audio synchronized with breathing animation

**Why It Matters:**
Audio cues help users maintain rhythm without watching the screen, especially during rapid breathing phases.

**Current Wbot Gap:**
Wbot only has ambient background sounds and phase transition chimes. No breath-synchronized audio guidance.

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority - Nice-to-Have Features

#### 2.5 Post-Session Results Screen ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**What InBreeze Has:**

- Summary of completed rounds
- Individual round durations
- Option to save or discard session
- Quick review of performance

**Why It Matters:**
Immediate feedback reinforces achievement and helps users track their best performances.

**~~Current Wbot Gap:~~** ✅ RESOLVED
Wbot now shows detailed completion statistics:

- ✅ Summary of completed rounds
- ✅ Per-round retention times
- ✅ Average and best retention stats
- ✅ "Do Another Round" option
- ✅ `ImmersiveBreathing` also includes completion screen with stats

---

#### 2.6 Onboarding Guide 🟡 PARTIAL

**What InBreeze Has:**

- Welcome screen introducing the app
- Language selection
- Method explanation (Wim Hof technique)
- 3-step instructional guide

**Why It Matters:**
New users need education on breathing techniques and safety guidelines.

**Current Wbot Gap:** 🟡 PARTIALLY RESOLVED

- ✅ First-time Wim Hof users see safety notices and technique explanation
- ✅ AI-generated introduction explains the technique
- ❌ Missing: Structured multi-step onboarding flow for app intro

---

### 🟢 Low Priority - Platform-Specific Features

#### 2.7 Multi-Language Support

InBreeze has full i18n support. Wbot could add this, but it's not breathing-specific.

#### 2.8 Theme Selection

InBreeze offers light/dark themes. Wbot already has theming at the app level.

#### 2.9 Screen-On Setting

InBreeze keeps screen active during exercises. This is a mobile-specific concern; web browsers handle this differently.

---

## 3. Integration Plan

### Philosophy: AI-Driven Progressive Enhancement

Rather than copying InBreeze feature-for-feature, we'll **enhance Wbot's unique AI-driven approach** by selectively integrating features that align with the chat-based wellness bot architecture.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Maintain chat integration** - Exercises remain embedded in conversation
2. **AI remains the guide** - Technique selection and customization driven by context
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Advanced features available when users need them
4. **Preserve simplicity** - Don't overwhelm first-time users

---

### Phase 1: Wim Hof Method Support 🏔️ ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** Fully implemented
**Completed:** January 2025

**Implementation Summary:**

- ✅ Backend: `WimHofTechnique` type, `WIM_HOF_TECHNIQUE` config, safety validation in `apps/ai/src/nodes/breathing_exercise/node.py`
- ✅ Frontend: `WimHofExercise.tsx` component with full phase support
- ✅ Hook: `useWimHofLoop.ts` managing round-based state machine
- ✅ Tests: `useWimHofLoop.test.tsx` with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Safety: First-time user warnings, experience-based access control
- ✅ Completion stats: Round breakdown with average/best retention times

#### Backend Changes (Reference)

**1. New Technique Type: Round-Based Structure**

Create a new technique category that supports the Wim Hof pattern:

```python
# apps/ai/src/nodes/breathing_exercise/node.py

class WimHofTechnique(TypedDict):
    """Configuration for Wim Hof Method breathing."""
    id: str
    name: str
    type: Literal["wim_hof"]  # New type
    rounds: int  # Number of rounds (3-4)
    breaths_per_round: int  # Rapid breaths (30)
    retention_target: int  # Suggested hold time in seconds (90)
    recovery_pause: int  # Rest between rounds (15)
    breath_tempo: int  # Milliseconds per breath (1500)

WIM_HOF_TECHNIQUE: WimHofTechnique = {
    "id": "wim_hof",
    "name": "Wim Hof Method",
    "type": "wim_hof",
    "rounds": 3,
    "breaths_per_round": 30,
    "retention_target": 90,
    "recovery_pause": 15,
    "breath_tempo": 1500,
    "description": "Rapid breathing followed by breath retention. Increases oxygen, "
                   "reduces stress, and boosts energy.",
    "best_for": ["energy", "stress relief", "immune support", "cold exposure prep"],
}
```

**2. Update Activity Data Structure**

```python
class WimHofActivityData(TypedDict):
    """Activity data for Wim Hof exercises."""
    type: Literal["activity"]
    activity: Literal["breathing_wim_hof"]  # New activity type
    status: Literal["ready"]
    technique: WimHofTechnique
    introduction: str
```

#### Frontend Changes

**1. New Component: `WimHofExercise.tsx`**

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/WimHofExercise/WimHofExercise.tsx

export interface WimHofExerciseProps {
  technique: WimHofTechnique;
  introduction?: string;
  onComplete?: () => void;
  onStop?: () => void;
}

export function WimHofExercise({ technique, ... }: WimHofExerciseProps) {
  const [phase, setPhase] = useState<'rapid' | 'retention' | 'recovery' | 'inhale_hold'>('rapid');
  const [currentRound, setCurrentRound] = useState(1);
  const [breathCount, setBreathCount] = useState(0);
  const [retentionTime, setRetentionTime] = useState(0);

  // Track retention durations for each round
  const [roundRetentions, setRoundRetentions] = useState<number[]>([]);

  // ... implementation
}
```

**2. Phase Breakdown:**

- **Rapid Breathing Phase:** Pulsing circle with breath counter (1/30, 2/30, etc.)
- **Retention Phase:** Stopwatch showing hold duration, subtle pulsing
- **Inhale Hold Phase:** Full expansion, 15-second countdown
- **Recovery Phase:** Gentle breathing, countdown to next round

**3. Visual Design:**

```css
/* Rapid breathing: Fast pulsing, energizing colors */
.wimHofCircleRapid {
  animation: rapidPulse 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-primary), var(--color-accent));
}

/* Retention: Slow subtle pulse, calming blue */
.wimHofCircleRetention {
  animation: gentlePulse 4s ease-in-out infinite;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4a90e2, #7b68ee);
}

/* Recovery: Soft green, very gentle movement */
.wimHofCircleRecovery {
  animation: gentlePulse 6s ease-in-out infinite;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #5fd39c, #41b883);
}
```

**4. Update Parser:**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/parseActivity.ts

export function parseActivity(content: string): ActivityData | null {
  // ... existing code

  if (data.activity === 'breathing_wim_hof') {
    return {
      type: 'wim_hof',
      technique: data.technique as WimHofTechnique,
      introduction: data.introduction,
    };
  }

  // ... existing breathing logic
}
```

#### AI Integration

**Update technique selection LLM to include Wim Hof:**

```python
selection_prompt = f"""...
When to suggest Wim Hof Method:
- User mentions feeling low energy, sluggish, or tired
- User is preparing for cold exposure or physical challenge
- User wants to boost immune system
- User has experience with breathwork (NOT for complete beginners)

WARNING: Do NOT suggest Wim Hof if:
- User has heart conditions, high blood pressure, or is pregnant
- User is a complete beginner to breathwork
- User is in an unsafe environment (driving, standing, etc.)
..."""
```

---

### Phase 2: Progress Tracking & History 📊 🟡 PARTIAL

**Status:** Database & hooks implemented, UI pending
**Remaining:** History view UI, graphs/charts, AI insights

**What's Implemented:**

- ✅ Database: `breathing_sessions` table with RLS (`database/migrations/005_breathing_sessions.sql`)
- ✅ Hook: `useBreathingSession.ts` with start/complete/update mutations
- ✅ Data format: `formatWimHofSessionData()` helper for session data

**What's Missing:**

- ❌ `BreathingHistory.tsx` component (list view)
- ❌ `BreathingStats.tsx` component (charts/graphs)
- ❌ Integration: Exercises don't call session tracking hooks yet
- ❌ AI-generated insights after sessions

#### Database Schema (Implemented)

**New Table: `breathing_sessions`**

```sql
-- database/migrations/005_breathing_sessions.sql

CREATE TABLE breathing_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  conversation_id UUID REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

  -- Session metadata
  technique_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'box', 'wim_hof', etc.
  technique_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,

  -- Technique-specific data (JSONB for flexibility)
  session_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  /*
    For continuous techniques: { cycles_completed: 4 }
    For Wim Hof: {
      rounds: [
        { round: 1, retention_seconds: 95, breaths: 30 },
        { round: 2, retention_seconds: 102, breaths: 30 },
        { round: 3, retention_seconds: 89, breaths: 30 }
      ],
      total_retention_seconds: 286
    }
  */

  -- User notes
  notes TEXT,
  mood_before TEXT, -- 'stressed', 'anxious', 'calm', 'tired'
  mood_after TEXT,

  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_breathing_sessions_user ON breathing_sessions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_breathing_sessions_started ON breathing_sessions(started_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_breathing_sessions_technique ON breathing_sessions(technique_id);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE breathing_sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own breathing sessions"
  ON breathing_sessions FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own breathing sessions"
  ON breathing_sessions FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own breathing sessions"
  ON breathing_sessions FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Frontend Changes

**1. New Hook: `useBreathingSessionTracking.ts`**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/breathing/useBreathingSessionTracking.ts

import { useMutation, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { supabase } from '../supabase';

export function useBreathingSessionTracking() {
  const startSession = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: {
      techniqueId: string;
      techniqueName: string;
      conversationId?: string;
    }) => {
      const { data: session, error } = await supabase
        .from('breathing_sessions')
        .insert({
          technique_id: data.techniqueId,
          technique_name: data.techniqueName,
          conversation_id: data.conversationId,
        })
        .select()
        .single();

      if (error) throw error;
      return session;
    },
  });

  const completeSession = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: {
      sessionId: string;
      sessionData: Record<string, unknown>;
      moodAfter?: string;
    }) => {
      const { error } = await supabase
        .from('breathing_sessions')
        .update({
          completed_at: new Date().toISOString(),
          session_data: data.sessionData,
          mood_after: data.moodAfter,
        })
        .eq('id', data.sessionId);

      if (error) throw error;
    },
  });

  return { startSession, completeSession };
}
```

**2. Update Components to Track Sessions**

```tsx
// In BreathingExercise.tsx and WimHofExercise.tsx

export function BreathingExercise({ ... }) {
  const { startSession, completeSession } = useBreathingSessionTracking();
  const [sessionId, setSessionId] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleStart = async () => {
    const session = await startSession.mutateAsync({
      techniqueId: technique.id,
      techniqueName: technique.name,
    });
    setSessionId(session.id);
    start();
  };

  const handleComplete = async () => {
    if (sessionId) {
      await completeSession.mutateAsync({
        sessionId,
        sessionData: { cycles_completed: state.currentCycle },
      });
    }
    onComplete?.();
  };

  // ...
}
```

**3. New Component: `BreathingHistory.tsx`**

This could be:

- A new page at `/breathing-history`
- A sidebar panel (like ConversationHistory)
- Inline in chat when user asks "show my breathing history"

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/BreathingHistory/BreathingHistory.tsx

export function BreathingHistory() {
  const { data: sessions } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['breathing-sessions'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('breathing_sessions')
        .select('*')
        .order('started_at', { ascending: false })
        .limit(50);

      if (error) throw error;
      return data;
    },
  });

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h2>Your Breathing Practice</h2>

      {/* Summary stats */}
      <BreathingStats sessions={sessions} />

      {/* Session list */}
      <div className={styles.sessionList}>
        {sessions?.map((session) => (
          <BreathingSessionCard key={session.id} session={session} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**4. AI Integration: Contextual Insights**

```python
# apps/ai/src/nodes/retrieve_memories/node.py

# Add breathing session retrieval alongside semantic memories

async def get_recent_breathing_sessions(user_id: str, limit: int = 5):
    """Fetch user's recent breathing sessions for context."""
    # Query Supabase for recent sessions
    # Return formatted summary for LLM context
```

```python
# In wellness system prompt
"""
You have access to the user's breathing practice history. Use this to:
- Congratulate them on consistency
- Suggest progression (e.g., "Last time you held for 85 seconds, try for 90 today")
- Recommend techniques based on past preferences
- Celebrate milestones (e.g., "That's your 10th session this month!")
"""
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Customization ⚙️ ❌ NOT STARTED

**Status:** Not implemented
**Priority:** Medium

#### Approach: AI-Driven Customization (Not Manual Settings)

Instead of adding a settings panel, we'll let users customize through **natural conversation**:

**User:** "Can we do box breathing but slower?"
**AI:** "Absolutely! I can adjust the box breathing pace. How about 6 seconds per phase instead of 4?"

**User:** "I want to do more than 4 cycles"
**AI:** "Great! How many cycles would you like? I'd recommend 6-8 for a deeper practice."

#### Implementation

**1. Update Technique Types to Support Customization**

```python
# apps/ai/src/nodes/breathing_exercise/node.py

class CustomizableBreathingTechnique(BreathingTechnique):
    """Extended technique with user customization."""
    user_customizations: dict[str, Any]  # { "durations": [6,6,6,6], "cycles": 8 }

async def customize_technique(
    base_technique: BreathingTechnique,
    user_request: str,
    state: WellnessState
) -> CustomizableBreathingTechnique:
    """Use LLM to interpret customization request."""

    customization_prompt = f"""
User wants to customize {base_technique['name']}:
Base configuration: {base_technique}
User request: "{user_request}"

Generate customization parameters:
- durations: [inhale, holdIn, exhale, holdOut] in seconds
- cycles: number of repetitions
- tempo: for Wim Hof, milliseconds per breath

Return JSON only.
"""

    # ... LLM call to parse customization
```

**2. Add Customization Detection to Activity Detection Node**

```python
# apps/ai/src/nodes/detect_activity/node.py

# Detect phrases like:
# - "slower breathing"
# - "more cycles"
# - "faster tempo"
# - "longer holds"

# Route to breathing_exercise node with customization flag
```

**3. Frontend: Dynamic Technique Rendering**

```tsx
// Update BreathingExercise to accept technique overrides

export interface BreathingTechnique {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  durations: [number, number, number, number];
  cycles: number;
  description: string;
  customizations?: {
    baseId: string; // Original technique this was based on
    userRequest: string; // "slower pace"
  };
}
```

---

### Phase 4: Enhanced Audio Experience 🎵 ❌ NOT STARTED

**Status:** Not implemented (ambient sounds exist, breath-sync audio does not)
**Priority:** Medium

#### Missing Audio Features

1. **Breath-synchronized sounds** (inhale/exhale audio)
2. **Voice guidance** (optional spoken instructions)
3. **More ambient sound options**

#### Implementation

**1. Breath-Synchronized Audio**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/components/BreathingExercise/useBreathingAudio.ts

const BREATH_SOUNDS = {
  inhale: '/audio/breath-in.ogg',
  exhale: '/audio/breath-out.ogg',
};

// Play on phase change
useEffect(() => {
  if (state.currentPhase === 'inhale') {
    playBreathSound('inhale');
  } else if (state.currentPhase === 'exhale') {
    playBreathSound('exhale');
  }
}, [state.currentPhase]);
```

**2. Voice Guidance (Optional Enhancement)**

```typescript
// Use Web Speech API for voice instructions
const synth = window.speechSynthesis;

function speakInstruction(text: string) {
  const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
  utterance.rate = 0.9; // Slightly slower for calmness
  utterance.pitch = 1.0;
  synth.speak(utterance);
}

// On phase change
if (settings.voiceGuidance) {
  speakInstruction(PHASE_LABELS[phase]);
}
```

**3. Additional Ambient Sounds**

Research and add:

- White noise
- Brown noise
- Tibetan singing bowls
- Nature sounds (birds, stream, wind)

---

### Phase 5: Results & Insights 📈 ❌ NOT STARTED

**Status:** Not implemented (basic completion screen exists, AI insights do not)
**Priority:** Medium

#### AI-Generated Post-Session Insights

Instead of just showing statistics, have the AI provide **personalized insights**:

**After Session:**

```typescript
// Frontend sends session data to AI
const sessionSummary = {
  technique: 'Wim Hof Method',
  rounds: [
    { retention: 95, breaths: 30 },
    { retention: 102, breaths: 30 },
    { retention: 89, breaths: 30 },
  ],
  totalDuration: 12 * 60, // 12 minutes
  moodBefore: 'stressed',
  moodAfter: 'calm',
};

// AI generates insight message
```

**AI Response:**

> Excellent session! You held your breath for an average of 95 seconds across 3 rounds, with your best round at 102 seconds. I noticed your second round was strongest - that's common as your body adjusts to the breathing pattern.
>
> You mentioned feeling stressed before we started. How are you feeling now?
>
> **Progress Note:** This is your 8th Wim Hof session this month. Your average retention has improved from 72 seconds to 95 seconds - that's 32% improvement!

#### Implementation

**1. New Node: `analyze_breathing_session`**

```python
# apps/ai/src/nodes/analyze_breathing_session/node.py

async def analyze_breathing_session(state: WellnessState) -> dict:
    """Generate insights from completed breathing session."""

    session_data = state.get("last_breathing_session")
    historical_data = await get_recent_breathing_sessions(state["user_context"]["id"])

    analysis_prompt = f"""
Analyze this breathing session and provide encouraging, insightful feedback:

Current session: {session_data}
Recent history: {historical_data}

Focus on:
1. Performance highlights (best rounds, improvements)
2. Patterns noticed
3. Progress over time
4. Gentle suggestions for next session

Tone: Warm, encouraging, data-informed but not clinical
"""

    # ... LLM generation
```

**2. Trigger Analysis After Completion**

```python
# apps/ai/src/graph/wellness.py

# Add conditional edge from breathing_exercise node:
# If session completed → analyze_breathing_session → generate_response
```

---

## 4. Technical Architecture Considerations

### 4.1 Component Organization

```
apps/web/src/components/
├── BreathingExercise/          # Existing (continuous breathing)

```

### 4.2 State Management Strategy

**Use TanStack Query for:**

- Fetching breathing session history
- Caching user preferences
- Optimistic updates when saving sessions

**Use React hooks for:**

- Active exercise state (ephemeral)
- Audio management
- Animation timing

**Avoid:**

- Creating a separate Zustand/Redux store for breathing
- Duplicating state between components

### 4.3 Type Safety

**Shared Types Package:**

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/breathing.ts

export type BreathingTechniqueType = 'continuous' | 'wim_hof';

export interface BaseBreathingTechnique {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  type: BreathingTechniqueType;
}

export interface ContinuousBreathingTechnique extends BaseBreathingTechnique {
  type: 'continuous';
  durations: [number, number, number, number];
  cycles: number;
}

export interface WimHofBreathingTechnique extends BaseBreathingTechnique {
  type: 'wim_hof';
  rounds: number;
  breathsPerRound: number;
  retentionTarget: number;
  recoveryPause: number;
  breathTempo: number;
}

export type BreathingTechnique = ContinuousBreathingTechnique | WimHofBreathingTechnique;

// Database types
export interface BreathingSession {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  conversation_id: string | null;
  technique_id: string;
  technique_name: string;
  started_at: string;
  completed_at: string | null;
  duration_seconds: number | null;
  session_data: Record<string, unknown>;
  notes: string | null;
  mood_before: string | null;
  mood_after: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### 4.4 Database Performance

**Indexes:**

```sql
-- Fast user session lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_breathing_sessions_user_started
ON breathing_sessions(user_id, started_at DESC);

-- Analytics queries
CREATE INDEX idx_breathing_sessions_technique_completed
ON breathing_sessions(technique_id, completed_at)
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

**Query Optimization:**

```typescript
// Fetch last 30 days with pagination
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['breathing-sessions', userId, page],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const thirtyDaysAgo = new Date();
    thirtyDaysAgo.setDate(thirtyDaysAgo.getDate() - 30);

    return supabase
      .from('breathing_sessions')
      .select('*')
      .gte('started_at', thirtyDaysAgo.toISOString())
      .order('started_at', { ascending: false })
      .range(page * 20, (page + 1) * 20 - 1);
  },
});
```

## 5. Visual Design Enhancements 🎨 🟡 PARTIAL

**Status:** ImmersiveBreathing component implements core visual enhancements
**Location:** `apps/web/src/components/ImmersiveBreathing/` (untracked - in development)

**What's Implemented:**

- ✅ `BreathingBackground.tsx` - Animated gradient with floating particles
- ✅ `BreathingCircle.tsx` - Apple Watch-style with 6 flower petals
- ✅ `BreathingControls.tsx` - Glassmorphism floating controls
- ✅ `BreathingProgress.tsx` - Progress indicator
- ✅ `useHapticFeedback.ts` - Web Vibration API for mobile feedback
- ✅ Phase-specific color transitions
- ✅ Intro → Active → Complete flow

**What's Missing:**

- ❌ Particle effects emanating from breathing circle
- ❌ Ripple effects on phase transitions
- ❌ Technique-specific visual themes (Box=geometric, 4-7-8=water, Wim Hof=energy)
- ❌ Confetti celebration on completion
- ❌ Audio waveform visualization
- ❌ SVG breathing path progress (using dots instead)

### Philosophy: More Interactive, Animated & Colorful

While InBreeze uses a simple teal color scheme, **Wbot already has a sophisticated, wellness-focused color palette**. We should leverage this to create breathing exercises that are visually engaging, emotionally resonant, and delightful to use.

**Current Wbot Design Strengths:**
✅ Beautiful phase-specific color transitions (sky blue → lavender → sage green)
✅ Glowing effects with phase-specific shadows
✅ Smooth cubic-bezier animations
✅ Radial gradients for depth
✅ Pulsing ring effect

**Areas for Enhancement:**
🎯 Add particle effects for breath visualization
🎯 Implement progress animations with celebratory moments
🎯 Create rich micro-interactions (haptic feedback, sound visualization)
🎯 Add ambient background animations
🎯 Enhance completion celebrations
🎯 Introduce technique-specific visual themes

---

### 5.1 Enhanced Breathing Circle Animations

#### Current Design

- Single circle that scales up/down
- Radial gradient with glow
- Phase-specific colors

#### Proposed Enhancements

**A. Particle System for Breath Visualization**

```css
/* Particle effects that emanate from circle during inhale */
@keyframes particleRise {
  0% {
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateY(-80px) scale(0.3);
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

.breathParticle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, var(--color-breath-inhale) 0%, transparent 70%);
  animation: particleRise 2s ease-out infinite;
}

/* Create multiple particles with staggered delays */
.breathParticle:nth-child(1) {
  animation-delay: 0s;
  left: 50%;
}
.breathParticle:nth-child(2) {
  animation-delay: 0.3s;
  left: 40%;
}
.breathParticle:nth-child(3) {
  animation-delay: 0.6s;
  left: 60%;
}
/* ... up to 12 particles in a circle pattern */
```

**B. Ripple Effect on Phase Transitions**

```css
/* Ripple expands when transitioning between phases */
@keyframes rippleExpand {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 0.6;
    border-width: 3px;
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(2.5);
    opacity: 0;
    border-width: 0px;
  }
}

.phaseTransitionRipple {
  position: absolute;
  width: 140px;
  height: 140px;
  border: 3px solid var(--color-breath-inhale);
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: rippleExpand 0.8s ease-out;
}
```

**C. Inner Light Pulse**

```css
/* Glowing center that pulses with breathing rhythm */
@keyframes centerPulse {
  0%,
  100% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 40px 15px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    box-shadow: 0 0 60px 25px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
}

.breathCircle::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  animation: centerPulse 4s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**D. Technique-Specific Visual Themes**

```css
/* Box Breathing: Geometric precision */
.techniqueBox .breathCircle {
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg); /* Square with rounded corners */
  transition: border-radius 4s ease;
}

.techniqueBox .circleInhale {
  border-radius: var(--radius-md); /* More angular during holds */
}

/* 4-7-8: Flowing water theme */
.technique478 .breathCircle {
  background: radial-gradient(
    ellipse 60% 50%,
    var(--color-wellness-ocean) 0%,
    var(--color-breath-inhale-light) 40%,
    transparent 70%
  );
}

.technique478 .breathCircle::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    transparent 0%,
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 10%,
    transparent 20%
  );
  animation: waterFlow 8s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes waterFlow {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(100%);
  }
}

/* Wim Hof: Energy surge theme */
.techniqueWimHof .breathCircle {
  background: radial-gradient(
    circle,
    #ffd700 0%,
    /* Gold center */ #ffa500 30%,
    /* Orange */ #ff6b6b 60%,
    /* Coral */ transparent 85%
  );
  box-shadow:
    0 0 40px rgba(255, 215, 0, 0.6),
    0 0 80px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.4),
    0 0 120px rgba(255, 107, 107, 0.2);
}

/* During rapid breathing: lightning effect */
.techniqueWimHof .rapidBreathing .breathCircle {
  animation: energySurge 1.5s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes energySurge {
  0%,
  100% {
    filter: brightness(1) saturate(1);
  }
  50% {
    filter: brightness(1.3) saturate(1.5);
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Ambient Background Animations

**Purpose:** Create an immersive environment that enhances relaxation without being distracting.

**A. Floating Orbs Background**

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/BreathingExercise/AmbientBackground.tsx

export function AmbientBackground({ isActive }: { isActive: boolean }) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.ambientBackground}>
      {/* Floating orbs that drift slowly */}
      {[...Array(8)].map((_, i) => (
        <div
          key={i}
          className={styles.floatingOrb}
          style={
            {
              '--delay': `${i * 2}s`,
              '--duration': `${15 + i * 3}s`,
              '--x-offset': `${Math.random() * 100}%`,
              '--y-offset': `${Math.random() * 100}%`,
            } as React.CSSProperties
          }
        />
      ))}

      {/* Gentle gradient overlay that shifts with breathing */}
      <div className={`${styles.gradientOverlay} ${isActive ? styles.gradientActive : ''}`} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
/* apps/web/src/components/BreathingExercise/AmbientBackground.module.css */

.ambientBackground {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 0;
}

.floatingOrb {
  position: absolute;
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, var(--color-breath-inhale-light) 0%, transparent 70%);
  opacity: 0.15;
  animation: floatDrift var(--duration, 20s) ease-in-out infinite;
  animation-delay: var(--delay, 0s);
  filter: blur(40px);
  left: var(--x-offset, 50%);
  top: var(--y-offset, 50%);
}

@keyframes floatDrift {
  0%,
  100% {
    transform: translate(0, 0) scale(1);
  }
  25% {
    transform: translate(30px, -40px) scale(1.2);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translate(-20px, -60px) scale(0.9);
  }
  75% {
    transform: translate(-40px, -20px) scale(1.1);
  }
}

.gradientOverlay {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    rgba(126, 200, 227, 0.05) 0%,
    rgba(155, 143, 212, 0.05) 50%,
    rgba(126, 212, 166, 0.05) 100%
  );
  transition: opacity 2s ease;
  opacity: 0;
}

.gradientActive {
  opacity: 1;
  animation: gradientShift 12s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes gradientShift {
  0%,
  100% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
  50% {
    background-position: 100% 50%;
  }
}
```

**B. Constellation/Star Field (Optional for Night Mode)**

```css
/* Twinkling stars in background */
.starfield {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-image:
    radial-gradient(2px 2px at 20% 30%, white, transparent),
    radial-gradient(2px 2px at 60% 70%, white, transparent),
    radial-gradient(1px 1px at 50% 50%, white, transparent),
    radial-gradient(1px 1px at 80% 10%, white, transparent);
  background-size: 200% 200%;
  animation: twinkle 8s ease-in-out infinite;
  opacity: 0.3;
}

@keyframes twinkle {
  0%,
  100% {
    opacity: 0.3;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0.6;
  }
}
```

---

### 5.3 Progress Visualization Enhancements

**Current:** Simple dots that change color
**Enhancement:** Animated path with celebratory effects

**A. Breathing Journey Path**

```tsx
// Visualize progress as a winding path
export function BreathingProgressPath({ currentCycle, totalCycles }: Props) {
  const progress = currentCycle / totalCycles;

  return (
    <svg className={styles.progressPath} viewBox="0 0 300 80">
      {/* Background path */}
      <path
        d="M 10,40 Q 75,10 150,40 T 290,40"
        fill="none"
        stroke="var(--color-neutral-200)"
        strokeWidth="4"
        strokeLinecap="round"
      />

      {/* Animated progress path */}
      <path
        d="M 10,40 Q 75,10 150,40 T 290,40"
        fill="none"
        stroke="url(#progressGradient)"
        strokeWidth="4"
        strokeLinecap="round"
        strokeDasharray="280"
        strokeDashoffset={280 * (1 - progress)}
        style={{ transition: 'stroke-dashoffset 1s ease' }}
      />

      {/* Gradient definition */}
      <defs>
        <linearGradient id="progressGradient" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%">
          <stop offset="0%" stopColor="var(--color-breath-inhale)" />
          <stop offset="50%" stopColor="var(--color-breath-hold)" />
          <stop offset="100%" stopColor="var(--color-breath-exhale)" />
        </linearGradient>
      </defs>

      {/* Milestones */}
      {[...Array(totalCycles)].map((_, i) => {
        const x = 10 + (280 / (totalCycles - 1)) * i;
        const completed = i < currentCycle;
        const active = i === currentCycle - 1;

        return (
          <g key={i}>
            {/* Milestone circle */}
            <circle
              cx={x}
              cy={40}
              r={active ? 8 : 6}
              fill={completed ? 'var(--color-success)' : 'var(--color-neutral-300)'}
              className={active ? styles.activeMilestone : ''}
            />

            {/* Celebration burst when milestone reached */}
            {completed && (
              <g className={styles.celebrationBurst}>
                {[...Array(8)].map((_, j) => {
                  const angle = (j * 45 * Math.PI) / 180;
                  const x2 = x + Math.cos(angle) * 20;
                  const y2 = 40 + Math.sin(angle) * 20;

                  return (
                    <line
                      key={j}
                      x1={x}
                      y1={40}
                      x2={x2}
                      y2={y2}

}
```

**B. Haptic Feedback (Web Vibration API)**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/components/BreathingExercise/useHapticFeedback.ts

export function useHapticFeedback() {
  const vibrate = useCallback((pattern: number | number[]) => {
    if ('vibrate' in navigator) {
      navigator.vibrate(pattern);
    }
  }, []);

  const breathCue = useCallback(() => {
    // Gentle pulse on inhale/exhale transitions
    vibrate([10, 50, 10]);
  }, [vibrate]);

  const phaseTransition = useCallback(() => {
    // Distinct pattern for phase changes
    vibrate([20]);
  }, [vibrate]);

  const celebrateCycle = useCallback(() => {
    // Celebration pattern when cycle completes
    vibrate([30, 100, 30, 100, 30]);
  }, [vibrate]);

  return { breathCue, phaseTransition, celebrateCycle };
}
```

**C. Sound Visualization (Audio Waveform)**

        <div
          key={i}
          className={styles.waveformBar}
          style={
            {
              '--delay': `${i * 0.1}s`,
              '--height': `${20 + Math.random() * 40}%`,
              '--volume': volume,
            } as React.CSSProperties
          }
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.waveformBar {
  width: 3px;
  height: var(--height, 30%);
  background: var(--color-breath-inhale);
  border-radius: 2px;
  opacity: calc(var(--volume, 0.5) * 0.6);

```

**Frontend:**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/components/WimHofExercise/__tests__/WimHofExercise.test.tsx

describe('WimHofExercise', () => {
  it('transitions from rapid breathing to retention', async () => {
    const { getByText } = render(
      <WimHofExercise technique={wimHofTechnique} />
    );

    fireEvent.click(getByText('Start Exercise'));

    // Rapid breathing phase
    expect(getByText(/BREATHE IN/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByText(/30/)).toBeInTheDocument(); // Breath count

    // Fast-forward to retention
    act(() => {
      vi.advanceTimersByTime(30 * 1500); // 30 breaths at 1500ms each
    });

    expect(getByText(/HOLD/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('tracks retention time accurately', async () => {
    // ... test stopwatch functionality
  });
});
```

### 6.2 Integration Tests

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/breathing/__tests__/sessionTracking.test.ts

describe('Breathing Session Tracking', () => {
  it('saves session to database on completion', async () => {
    const { startSession, completeSession } = useBreathingSessionTracking();

    const session = await startSession.mutateAsync({
      techniqueId: 'wim_hof',
      techniqueName: 'Wim Hof Method',
    });

    expect(session.id).toBeDefined();

    await completeSession.mutateAsync({
      sessionId: session.id,
      sessionData: {
        rounds: [{ retention: 90, breaths: 30 }],
      },
    });

    const { data } = await supabase
      .from('breathing_sessions')
      .select()
      .eq('id', session.id)
      .single();

    expect(data.completed_at).toBeDefined();
    expect(data.session_data.rounds).toHaveLength(1);
  });
});
```

### 6.3 E2E Tests (Playwright)

```typescript
// e2e/breathing-exercise.spec.ts

test('complete wim hof breathing session', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login
  await page.goto('/');
  await loginAsTestUser(page);

  // Navigate to chat
  await page.goto('/chat');

  // Ask for breathing exercise
  await page.fill('[data-testid="message-input"]', 'I need an energy boost');
  await page.click('[data-testid="send-button"]');

  // AI should suggest Wim Hof
  await expect(page.locator('text=Wim Hof Method')).toBeVisible();

  // Start exercise
  await page.click('text=Start Exercise');

  // Verify rapid breathing phase
  await expect(page.locator('text=BREATHE IN')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.locator('text=/30')).toBeVisible();

  // Complete full session (with time manipulation)
  // ... verify completion message

  // Check history
  await page.goto('/breathing-history');
  await expect(page.locator('text=Wim Hof Method')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## 7. Migration & Rollout Plan

### 7.1 Backward Compatibility

**Ensure existing breathing exercises continue to work:**

```typescript
// Detect technique type and render appropriate component

export function BreathingActivityRenderer({ activityData }: Props) {
  if (activityData.activity === 'breathing_wim_hof') {
    return <WimHofExercise {...activityData} />;
  }

  // Default to continuous breathing
  return <BreathingExercise {...activityData} />;
}
```

### 7.2 Feature Flags

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/config/features.ts

export const BREATHING_FEATURES = {
  wim_hof: true, // Phase 1
  session_tracking: true, // Phase 2
  customization: false, // Phase 3 (not yet released)
  voice_guidance: false, // Phase 4 (experimental)
} as const;

// Use in components
if (BREATHING_FEATURES.session_tracking) {
  trackSession();
}
```

### 7.3 Rollout Phases

**Week 1-2: Wim Hof MVP**

- Backend: Add Wim Hof technique definition
- Frontend: Build basic WimHofExercise component (no retention tracking yet)
- Test with internal team
- Deploy to production with feature flag

**Week 3-4: Retention Tracking**

- Add stopwatch functionality
- Per-round statistics
- Test accuracy of timing

**Week 5-6: Database & History**

- Create breathing_sessions table
- Implement session tracking hooks
- Build basic history view (list only)

**Week 7-8: Analytics & Insights**

- Add AI-generated insights
- Build graphs and visualizations
- Polish history UI

**Week 9-10: Customization**

- AI-driven customization parsing
- Dynamic technique generation
- Test various customization requests

**Week 11-12: Audio Enhancements**

- Breath-synchronized sounds
- Additional ambient options
- Optional voice guidance

## 8. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### 8.1 UX Questions

**Q1: Where should breathing history live?**

- Option A: New top-level page `/breathing-history`
- Option B: Sidebar panel (like conversation history)
- Option C: Inline in chat (AI shows it when asked)
- **Recommendation:** Option C initially (AI-driven), Option A later for power users

**Q2: Should we support quick-access to breathing exercises outside chat?**

- Option A: Floating action button (FAB) to start breathing from anywhere
- Option B: Standalone `/breathe` route with technique selection
- Option C: Keep it chat-only
- **Recommendation:** Option C (maintains chat-centric philosophy)

**Q3: How should customization UI work?**

- Option A: Settings panel before starting
- Option B: AI conversation only
- Option C: Hybrid (AI suggests, but user can tweak)
- **Recommendation:** Option B (most aligned with Wbot's approach)

### 8.2 Technical Questions

**Q1: Should we use WebRTC for audio to avoid CORS issues?**

- InBreeze uses local audio files
- We're using fetch() which could have CORS problems
- **Decision Needed:** Test with current approach, fallback to WebRTC if needed

**Q2: How to handle timezone issues in session timestamps?**

- Store in UTC, display in user's timezone
- **Recommendation:** Use `TIMESTAMPTZ` in Postgres, handle conversion in frontend

**Q3: Should breathing sessions be tied to conversations?**

- Current design: Optional `conversation_id` field
- Pro: Can see breathing in context of conversation
- Con: Breathing history might be separate concern
- **Recommendation:** Keep optional link, allow standalone sessions

| Session tracking (database)   | ✅ Complete                      |
| Progress tracking UI          | ❌ Not Started                   |
| AI-generated insights         | ❌ Not Started                   |
| Conversational customization  | ❌ Not Started                   |

### Next Steps

1. ~~**Review & Approve:** Discuss this plan with the team~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~**Technical Spike:** Prototype retention timer and session tracking~~ ✅ Done
3. **Integrate session tracking:** Connect `useBreathingSession` hook to exercise components
4. **Build BreathingHistory UI:** Create history view with session list and basic stats
5. **Add AI insights:** Implement post-session analysis node
6. **Polish ImmersiveBreathing:** Add remaining visual effects (confetti, ripples)

### What's Working

The foundation is solid:

- ✅ Wim Hof exercises work end-to-end with full round/retention/recovery flow
- ✅ Session data can be saved to the database
- ✅ ImmersiveBreathing provides an Apple Watch-inspired visual experience
- ✅ Haptic feedback works on supported mobile devices
- ✅ Safety checks prevent beginners from accessing advanced techniques

### What's Left

The main gaps are in **user-facing progress features**:

- History view to see past sessions
- Charts showing retention time improvement over time
- AI-generated insights and encouragement
